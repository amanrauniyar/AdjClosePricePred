Step 1: Run the RFR_model.py file if you don't want to use previous validation random dataset for final 
	prediction of adjusted closing price. But, make sure all associated other files (except python) 
	are closed especially the validation datasets for three stocks and their pickle files to avoid the
	permission error to overwrite the files as the name is fixed.

	Or,if you are fine using previous validation random dataset for final prediction of adjusted 
	closing price then, you can skip this step and go directly to step 2.

	If you ran it, then it will create/overwrite three randomized valid datasets for each stock using 10% 
	of the overall data to use it for validation later on and also it create three models with regular and 
	scaled values and save as pickle files to use for loading it up in GUI for final prediction of adjusted 
	closing price based on the selected values of the stock it gets as input features after passing it to 
	the model.

Step 2: Run the GUI.py file which brings an interactive GUI to visulaize the validastion datasets. And then you 
	can get an data entry from the validation dataset as you desire and predict the adjusted closing price 
	based on the selected values of the stock with the help of the loaded model after input features are passed. 
	If you want to test it again the, you can click the "Reset" button and play with the GUI and then get the 
	output. You can do as long as you like. And once you are done, you can click the "Quit" button to close the 
	GUI.
